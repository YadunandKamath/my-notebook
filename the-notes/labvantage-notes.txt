* LabVantage Master Data - core, top-level, non-transactional, static data that defines the structure of the system.

* Sample Lifecycle:
	- any product is called sample.
	- Sample Management:
		Sample Submission >>
		Receive and Register samples >>
		Print labels >>
		Create tests >>
		Enter results >>
		Validate results >>
		Appropriate results >>
		Report results
	- Sample Status Transition:
		Initial
		Initial -> Received/Cancelled
		Initial -> InProgress / Received -> InProgress
		InProgress -> Completed
		Completed -> Reviewed

* Parameter: 
	- variable that holds some value based on which tests can be performed
	- represents a property/condition to be tested

	-- Parameter limit and Limit rule 
	-- Specification and Specification Rule
	-- Instrument 
	-- Analyst 
	
* Test Methods - contains Parameter Lists, Specifications and instructions to perform test 

* QC Batch Creation 
	- create a Batch instance in LV database and choose QC Method and Samples to be tested 
	- an Analyst or Department can be assigned to a QC Batch 
	- results can be entered manually or from instruments

* QC Batch Evaluation 
	- checks whether batch follows Evaluation rule 
	- Control charts can be used to identify variations in a process

* Batch:
  - a batch is a lot of any product that needs to be tested/group of samples that needs to be tested using same methods
  -- Sampling plan - defines no of batch samples created and tests to be performed
  -- Product variant - supplier/manufacturer of a product
  -- Product variant rule - level of testing conducted
	
* Version 
	- defines status of an entity
		-- Provisional - in process of being revised
		-- Current - approved
		-- Active - previous approved version that can still be used '
		-- Expired - no longer usable
		
* Template - predefine every attribute about a sample/test
	
* Track Item - an ID used to track samples in LIMS

* Consumables
	- single/mixture of chemical entities
		-- Consumable Type 
		-- Consumable Container

* Sapphire Data Collection (SDC) 
	- group of records in one or more database tables that collectively define an entity associated with data.
	- Types:
		+ "Core" and "System" provide essential functionality (OOB - Out Of the Box). 
			-- cannot be created or deleted. Can only be viewed and SDIs can be added.
		+ "User" is created by us.
			-- all operations possible.
		+ "Definition" defines information and links relevant to specific operations.
	- System Admin Menu -> Configuration Tram Line -> SDC Tram Stop (shows list page of all SDCs)
	- SDC naming convention is same as Java class naming convention 
	- Under Security/Update Options tab 
		-- Access Control
			+ Open Role
			+ Restrictive Role 
			+ Departmental
			+ SDI Security
			+ Not Implemented
		-- Audit Method
		-- Versioned
		-- Key Generation
	? why can't we add delete button for SDC

	-- Related Items
	
* Dashboards 
	- display discrete collections of information within a single page
	- configured and driven by Gizmos 
	- Menu picker Gizmo -> Create Dashboard

		-- My Dashboard -  collect and display Bulletin, Sitemap, and Workflow information
		
* Category - logical group of SDIs related to same SDC 
	
* Interfaces supported by LabVantage:
	- AttachmentHandler
	- DBAccess
	- LogonRequestValidator
	
* Gizmos 
	- SDIs that define dynamic object-oriented blocks of functionality that can be plugged into different parts of the 
	application to expose functionality
	- To create a Gizmo SDI, go to the Gizmo List page (System Admin → Web Page Designer → Gizmos), then add a Gizmo by clicking "Add".
	
* SDC/Custom Business Rule 
	- any class extending BaseSDCRules
	- class file name must be same as SDC name
